      title: Enabling Data Flows in in Greater Manchester Connected Health City
---
As part of Connected	Health	Cities we have spent	the last three years	building a pilot learning health care system in Greater	Manchester. Actionable health intelligence is dependent	on the	timely	flow of data.	Setting up a new data flow can be convoluted. By	sharing our learning	we hope to speed up this process.	

We report on the governance	approach, the	workforce involved in sharing data, and describe	how data flowed for three projects	- with	the‘take home	message’ that	health	data flows are dependent on	a wide	base of skilled personnel.
