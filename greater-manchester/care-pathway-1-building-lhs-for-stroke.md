**Project Overview**

The signs of a stroke can begin suddenly.  Often, it’s a paramedic that is the first person to assess a patient suffering from stroke and depending on how severe their symptoms are they may be taken to a specialist stroke unit or to their local hospital.

There is a lot of support available for people that have had a stroke.  This support can come from GPs, doctors working in specialist units, from local hospitals and out in the community.  Each of these services record information in their databases but there isn’t any way for doctors, health professionals, and researchers to get an overview of how patients flow through and in-between services.

Researchers working on this project analysed data from different stroke services to develop a comprehensive overview of how stroke patients pass between primary, secondary and community care in Manchester and Salford. This enabled a better understanding of the patient journey, the ability to spot gaps in the care that was offered and suggestions for improvements to support stroke patients and ensure services are efficient and well-coordinated.
