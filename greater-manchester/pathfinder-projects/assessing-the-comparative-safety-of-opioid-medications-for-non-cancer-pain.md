**Background**	

Opioid	use for non-cancer pain has increased considerably and has been associated with fatal overdoses, the majority being unintentional. The most serious opioid-related adverse event is respiratory depression	(RD).	

**Objectives**	

(i) Assess the comparative risk of	RD in opioid users for non-malignant pain	
(ii) Use routinely-collected electronic patient records	(EPR)	in secondary care for research.	

**Methods**

Opioid	users	from Salford hospital EPR were identified(2014-17). Patients with prior malignancy were excluded using ICD-10 codes. Electronic National Early Warning Scores were used to define an RD event as any one of the following: respiratory rate (RR) ≤8/min, RR ≤10/min and O2 saturations<94%, RR≤10/min and altered consciousness, or dispensed naloxone	use. Administered medication was categorised as opioid monotherapy or	combination of opioids. Primary analysis attributed RD to opioids during a risk window of ‘on drug+1day’, unless the patient switched to another opioid. Patients contributed follow up time	for a particular drug from dispensed drug start date until day after discontinuation, 1st RD event, death or end of hospital admission. Crude rates/1000 person years(pyrs) and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine comparative risk of administered opioids and RD, adjusted	using	propensity scores derived using inverse probability of treatment weights. Daily dose converted to	MME, was entered as an interaction	term.	

**Results**

33,341	opioid	users	were	included: 18,325 female (55%); mean age (SD) 53(20)years.There	were 515 RD events on treatment. The highest crude rates (95%	CI) were on fentanyl	[222(106,465)], oxycodone [221 (182,270)] and combination opioids [260(224,300)]. Compared to codeine the highest risk was observed in combination opioid [HR3.1	(95% CI 2.4,4.0)] and fentanyl groups [HR	3.5(95% CI 1.6,7.7)]. In the adjusted model using MME, compared to codeine, patients on combination opioids had	an adjusted HR of 1.01 (95%	CI:1.0,1.02). Patients experienced	RD on opioid doses as low as codeine 30mg	PRN; fentanyl patch 50mcg/hr every	72hrs;	oxycodone 1.25mg QDS; tramadol 50mg PRN.	

**Conclusion**	

Fentanyl, oxycodone and combination opioids have	the highest risk of RD, however following	adjustment the risk no longer remained significant. The	study’s strengths include physiological parameters to define RD and dispensed medications to define exposure. Access to this rich, novel data source for pharmacoepidemiological research will deliver an improved understanding of how opioids can affect patient safety.
