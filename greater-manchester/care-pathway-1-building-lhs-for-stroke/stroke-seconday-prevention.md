**Introduction**	
There	is a high risk of recurrent stroke	for all patients who	suffer	a stroke or transient ischemic attack(TIA) in the weeks following the	initial event, with most recurrent	strokes occurring within 90	days.	In order to investigate the	prevalence, frequency,and methods to reduce the occurrence of secondary/recurrent stroke in Manchester, the Greater Manchester Connected Health City (GM CHC) Secondary	Prevention Workstream was commissioned.	

**Methods**	
Firstly, to gain a greater understanding of the current	landscape of stroke care and recurrence within Salford,	a large cohort of	data was acquired via the Salford Integrated Record (SIR) and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP).	This cohort of	data was to provide an insight into how well stroke patients are currently managed to blood pressure and	atrial	fibrillation targets	within	Salford.  We also introduced three	pilot	interventions	in three separate GP	practices in Salford. Including enhanced communication links with the	Early Supportive Discharge team, an increased role for practice-based	pharmacists, and the	introduction of the Performance Improvement plaN GeneratoR (PINGR) software on the practice system. A qualitative evaluation also took place alongside the introduction of pilot interventions into	practices.	

**Results**	
The cohort of	SSNAP data identified 1,628	strokes between 31/12/12 to 13/11/17,and during the same time period,	a subset of the SIR data identified 3,817 patients who had experienced a stroke.  Due to the discrepancy in the number of records, data cleaning identified 2,995 of the patients as having either a stroke or TIA. Of these, 1,424 (47.5%) of the patients	were identified as having a stroke in SSNAP within the same time period. The	remaining discrepancy in the data is likely due to SSNAP not recording TIAs.	Of the	cohort	only 38.7% had a record of their systolic blood pressure, 2.5% were recorded as having atrial fibrillation prior to stroke, and only	22% had received an ECG at some point. The pilot interventions revealed through the PINGR system that there were only 22 patients who were	discharged in Salford over a 12-month period who	were not under the care of the ESD	team, the communication link between practice staff and the ESD team has now been established and	will continue usage beyond the project, and the practice-based	pharmacists were keen to scale-up their enhanced	role in stroke care, despite the limited number of patients identified within the practice	during	the project	period.

**Conclusion**	
The quality and discrepancies within the SIR and	SSNAP data have revealed that current recording and coding practices for stroke are	not accurate enough and that improved recording will lead to better monitoring of patients	post-stroke.	The three pilot interventions were	successful in	being introduced in practice and will continue to be utilised beyond the end	of the	project. However, due to the limited scale of all three, further funding is unlikely to scale up any of the three interventions at this time.
