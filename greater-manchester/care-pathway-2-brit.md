      title: Building Rapid Interventions to reduce antimicrobial resisTance and overprescribing of antibiotics
---

The	BRIT	project	aims	to	develop	and	implement	at	scale	the	infrastructure	for	collecting	and	analysing	data	on	prescribing,	clinical	interventions	and	patient	demographics	in	order	to	better	understand	the	public	drivers	for	antibiotic	prescribing	in	the	UK.	The	project	team	has	developed	and	tested	simple	interventions	to	refine	antibiotic	prescribing	in	locations,	facilities or	sub-groups	(of	patients	and/or	clinicians).	

A	web-based	platform	(dashboard)	has	been	designed	to	help	users	develop	a	better	understanding	of	how	antibiotics	are	currently	prescribed	and	where	prescribing	can	be	improved.	The	dashboard	has	two	types	of	users,	i.e.	Practice	level	users	and	CCG	level	users	or	policy	makers.	Features	of	the	dashboard	include	benchmarking,	so	a	practice	can	see	their	prescribing	rates	adjusted	by STAR-PU,	and	compare	to	a	regional	average	/	national	average.	There	is	also	information	on	the	variability	of	prescribing across	practices	for	each	infectious	condition,	where	users	can	see	what	antibiotic	drugs	are	being	prescribed	for	each condition.	Practices	will	also	be	informed	which	of	these	antibiotic	prescriptions	are	deviating	from	the	guidelines	with	links to	local	prescribing	recommendations.	In	addition,	risk	profiling	where	a	patient’s	risk	of	an	infection related	complication	can	be	identified	in	a	30-day	window.	Over-prescribing	to	low-risk	patients	or	under	prescribing	to	high-risk	patients	can	also	be	visualised.	

The	web-based	platform	has	been	designed	to	incorporate	pertinent	issues	facing	clinicians	in Primary	Care and	can	be	tailored	according	to	the	user’s	requirements.	For	example,	to	explore	drivers	of	antibiotic	prescribing,	complex	models	are	fitted	to	national	and	local	data	to	understand	the	factors	that	influence	suboptimal	prescribing.
