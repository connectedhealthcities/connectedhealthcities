### About Connected Health Cities
        
Connected Health Cities (CHCs) improved health services for patients in the of North England by making use of under-used data and applying the latest technologies and methodologies to enhance local health needs. 

We worked with our patients to ensure our research was relevant and practically make real impacts on public health.  You may not have heard of  us, but you will have heard our mantra #datasaveslives

CHC has now changed. We're sharing everything we learnt with you, your region and your country so that you can benefit from our work â€” for free.
