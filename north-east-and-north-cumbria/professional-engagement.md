The NENC CHC team developed and expanded networks to enable regional data sharing and engage a wider audience in data driven improvement and innovation. 

Existing organisations were included in workforce development where possible (e.g. Chief Information Officer community), while new ones were created where gaps existed (e.g. Chief Clinical Information Officer (CCIO) network). The team were active online including accessible platforms such as Twitter to reach relevant and interested audiences. The result today is a 850+ strong (and growing) online and face-to-face Practitioner network linking health and care professionals across the region with an interest in data sharing.
