The Great North Care Record Network has been established to support the development of the Great North Care Record across the North East and North Cumbria. 
 
The Network provides an opportunity for professionals working in healthcare, social care and academia to come together and to help implement the record across the region. 
 
The programme has been established and is led by local health and social care professionals and academics, who are committed to the benefits of better information sharing, in a safe and secure setting. 
 
The network meets on a face to face basis and has an online network â€“ Discourse. 

The networking event in July 2018 was targeted at health and care professionals and academics. Approximately 350 participants attended to discuss how permission can best be captured from 3.6million people across the region to share (or not share) their health and social care information for direct care, research and planning.
