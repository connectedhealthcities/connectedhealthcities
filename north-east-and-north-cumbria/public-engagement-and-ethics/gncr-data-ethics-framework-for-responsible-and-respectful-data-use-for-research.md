      title: GNCR Data Ethics Framework for Responsible and Respectful Data Use for Research
---

Understanding public views about data sharing has been central in shaping the GNCR Ethics Framework. 

CHC NENC has undertaken a range of public engagement exercises and research with NENC publics.  
- Focus groups with people of NENC (Teesside & Newcastle Universities, Healthwatch) 
- Co-production workshops and peopleâ€™s Panels (Newcastle University) 
- Preference tool development People said that they expect and want to have control of their data.  

GNCR will continue to talk with the NENC public to ensure its ethical practice aligns with their expectations of data use and control. 

The GNCR Ethics Framework for Responsible and Respectful Data Use is also based on national and international data access governance policy and practice developed by The Data Group of the Policy Ethics and Life Sciences research centre, led by Prof Madeleine Murtagh (www.metadac.ac.uk and www.ga4gh.org/work_stream/regulatory-ethics/). The approach is informed by and compliant with NHS Information Governance regionally and nationally.
