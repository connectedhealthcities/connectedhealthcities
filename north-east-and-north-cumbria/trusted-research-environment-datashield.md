## Great North Care Record (GNCR)

GNCR now gives access to GP records to hospitals, mental health, ambulance and out of hours. The programme works with General Practices across the North East and North Cumbria and 25 NHS trusts and Local Authorities, and 12 CCGs saving at least Â£8m per year.

This formed the basis for further development for the TRE and ARCHIE.
