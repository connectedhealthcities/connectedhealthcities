The scale, scope and complexity of this SPCS Project has been very challenging, especially within the resources available.  It has been and continues to be delivered through the tenacity and high levels of energy, flexibility and commitment of a core and wider team of partners. 

The SPCS Project is well on its way to delivering the intended outputs of the project. The full impact will take longer to evaluate. However, the learning through the design and implementation phases are demonstrating a robust methodology that is gaining the confidence of partners and potential strategic sponsors. The outcome of these discussions will be the proof of the wider commitment, going forward.  
The project has delivered:

• Robust criteria for defining an optimal EPaCCS system. These criteria were based on consensus from all regional stakeholder partners in the Palliative and End of Life Network. They focused on care around the patient, the systems involved and an agreed regional data set based on national datasets and requirements

• A Shared Palliative Care Summary that is accessible to, viewed (and used) by practitioners to inform timely responses and care delivery (regardless of where the patient is) 

• Insight into technical issues/risks arising during implementation across large and complex organisations and how to revise any issues with the Intra-operable system provider in a timely manner (appendix 2c) 

• Insight into Information Governance and Clinical Safety Risk Issues for practical, clinical, intra-operable systems that are pushing the boundaries of current developments (appendix 6 Governance policies) 

• Insight into (enhanced) relationship and trust between practitioners (quality/reliable use of system) e.g. voluntary initiatives to develop shared data and learning across agencies as project 

• Identification, and adaptation of training needs, communications and quality issues relating to personal care recording according to the requirements of those organisations and working with their current models/methodologies. (Appendix 2c and 4, Amys page model, University evaluation material from planning phases, Key Learning Points in this report) 

• Material/data to inform business model, policy and potential evaluation (appendix 3 Data profiles) • A leadership/partnership team that can influence/inform future requirements (appendix 7) 

• Construction of standardised data and performance indicators for regional use across the heath care systems • Contribution to the development of regional digital pathways and developing regional governance structures • Contribution to national EPaCCS FIHR standards 

• Links to other national EPaCCS models and work  

• We also have a model of formal evaluation that enhances credibility of the project with professionals and enhances their engagement in the process
