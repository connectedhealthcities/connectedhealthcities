    title: NENC CHC Communications Final Report
---

The communications workstream as part of the Connected Health Cities (CHC) programme in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) sought to raise the profile of the CHC brand and its care pathway programmes. 

The care pathway projects funded by CHC in the NENC explored how data routinely collected could be analysed in new ways to produce powerful new insights which ultimately improve patient care. The care pathway projects selected and funded in the NENC were each exploring different elements of data sharing either through secondary uses of data, or directly to improve patient care.

These three care pathway projects were an opportunity to implement a Learning Health System â€“ which would influence the development of the Great North Care Record (GNCR), a regional integrated care record for the NENC, which would not only share data to support direct patient care, but also make better uses of existing data and make it accessible to researchers. 

The communications workstream shared messages about the work taking place using a variety of communications techniques and channels.
