intro: | #this means everything indented below is included
    There were four Connected Health Cities (CHC) covering the North of England and coordinated by a central Hub based at The University of Manchester.

    The role of the Hub was to bring together the four CHC so that they could share learning, resources and ensure that what worked in one region can be replicated in another.
