One of the key workstreams in NWC was to support the development of digital literacy within the workforce in health and social care. This was specifically focussed on enhancing the use of data and supporting the integration of digital health into service transformation and to develop a more advanced knowledge of data science.  In collaboration with local organisations, the NWC team sucessfully developed and delivered new training modules and accredited courses and supported postgraduate level applied research studies in data science.
