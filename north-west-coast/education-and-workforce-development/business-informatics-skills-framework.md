The Business Informatics Skills Framework (BISF) Prototype intended to provide an initial tool to create a professional framework to improve the capability of the analytical workforce. The BISF will enable individuals to produce a portfolio of evidence endorsed by managers outlining their competency against an identified skill set for their role assisting them in identifying the relevant skills required to further progress their career within that area.  

This accreditation system builds on existing frameworks such as the Health Informatics Career Framework (HICF) and Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). Ultimately, it will facilitate the identification, development and enhancement of the capabilities of the NHS and health and social care analytical workforce.   

The purpose of the BISF is to support the professional and personal development of the analytical workforce from entry level through to professional level. It will enable individuals, organisations and health care systems to assess their knowledge base, identify gaps and signpost to learning resources to develop and enhance these skills. It will also support rounded analysts who, in addition to strong technical skills, have well-developed social and interpersonal skills to communicate effectively with clinicians and senior managers, thereby becoming more actively embedded in decision-making both within their organisations and across the wider health economy.
