The Connected Health Cities (CHC) Information Dissemination survey was developed and circulated between February and April 2018 with a view to improving the CHC team’s understanding of how business intelligence reports, and general business intelligence outputs relating to health service activity, were typically disseminated within healthcare organisations across the NHS. 
 
The requirement to undertake the survey arose following a review of the current progress of the various North West Coast (NWC) Connected Health Cities workstreams, soon to be published as the ‘NWC CHC Strategic Review Report’, which identified a series of potential challenges around the effective dissemination of the innovative intelligence currently being developed within the NWC CHC work programme. 
 
The NWC CHC programme was initially set up to deliver a ‘demonstrator model’ that would highlight how a ‘learning health system’ (LHS) could operate within the NWC and the review highlighted that while all the work currently being undertaken within the programme was producing excellent outputs in line with the required project outputs, the plan for ensuring that this work could be re-introduced and embedded into local systems, and processes, required further investigation. 
 
The review team wanted to understand how information and intelligence were currently being disseminated within, and across organisations and wanted to support these investigations with some facts and evidence wherever possible. The team included individuals with experience of working to deliver business intelligence within healthcare organisations and their anecdotal observations suggested that a deeper dive into local practice for intelligence delivery was required. 
 
The Survey was developed as a consequence of these observations and was focused on understanding the following: 
 
- The nature of operational intelligence delivery and dissemination within health and care organisations 

- Common challenges faced by information teams in disseminating intelligence across their organisation  

- Successes that have been driven by effective delivery of intelligence within, and across, organisations 

- How best practice in any one area might be shared and adopted in another area
