One of the main aims of The Connected Health City programme is to equip the healthcare workforce with the digital, analytical, contextual and management/leadership skills to improve the conversation between individual professionals and groups. 
 
As part of its commitment to developing digital health skills in the current and future workforce in the North West Coast, the Innovation Agencyâ€™s Coaching Academy ran a course entitled: Coaching for Spread and Adoption: Digital Health. 
 
This seven month coached programme for NHS staff and community stakeholders was made possible by funding from Connected Health Cities. 
 
Analysis of its resulting data and stakeholder narratives has: 
 
-1) Informed understanding of digital health transformation within the North West coast health and care system. 
 
-2) Provided insight into challenges and opportunities for leveraging the enabling power of workforce to implement and spread digital innovation.
