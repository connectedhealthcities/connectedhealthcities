The NHS and social care system its facing its biggest ever challenge - **workforce**.  
 
Across NHS trusts there is a shortage of more than 100,000 staff. With no growth in sight to the supply of workforce over the next 10 years, the gap between the growing demand for health services and system capacity is widening. 

Based on current trends, it is projected that the gap between staff needed and the number available could reach almost 250,000 by 2030.  

As part of Connected Health Cities’ commitment to engaging with industry and developing workforce, the Innovation Agency, the Academic Health Science Network for the North West Coast, hosted an event on how digital innovation can support workforce strategies to improve healthcare and generate economic benefits for the region. 
 
This Ecosystem event focused on the vast array of digital solutions and technology that promise to change the way we deliver care and manage workforce logistics, to help close the workforce gap.
