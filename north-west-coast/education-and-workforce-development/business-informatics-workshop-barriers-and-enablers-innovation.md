One of the core challenges the Connected Health Cities Project (CHC) set for itself was to work with the Health Service Business Analytics community to understand how they support the wider service in generating and utilising data.

Working closely with that community, CHC sought to identify the nature of the cultural, technical, financial and governance challenges that prevent the efficient integration of complex analysis algorithms, or general business intelligence outputs generated by data specialists within healthcare, academia or the private sector, into local, operational NHS information reporting platforms.

That work has taken the form of a range of structured activities in partnership with the NW Informatics Skills Development Network (ISDN), a healthcare community of staff at all levels of seniority that are involved in Business Analytics function in the North West Health Service.

This report details the activities undertaken, initial findings and headline recommendations that have resulted from that work.
