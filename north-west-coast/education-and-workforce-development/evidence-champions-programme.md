The 'Evidence Champions' Programme was a fully funded Postgraduate Certificate course and included 20 participants from a range of sectors and roles, including clinicians, data analysts, commissioners, and quality leads from across the NW Coast area.  

The programme was funded through the Connected Health Cities (CHC) Programme, and delivered as a collaborative initiative between Lancaster Universityâ€™s Centre for Educational Training and Development (CETAD), and the Innovation Agency (Academic Health Science Network for the North West Coast). 

The main aim of this programme was to develop a community of professionals focused on utilising data and digital technologies, to enhance evidence-based approaches to service design and delivery.
