NWC CHC worked closely with small and large businesses, academia and healthcare professionals to deliver new programmes and develop partnerships. 

Starting with a mapping exercise, key digital assets across a range of industry sectors in the North West were identified giving greater understanding of availability of skillsets in health innovation, data science and digital health. This informed the national AHSN Network Report Accelerating Artificial Intelligence in health and care on skills and commissioning gaps and supported the development of new workforce education programmes.
