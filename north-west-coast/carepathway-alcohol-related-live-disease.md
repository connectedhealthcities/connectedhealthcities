The model for a Learning Healthcare System for the North West Coast pilots was to first establish a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) hosting anonymised hospital administrative data. 

Work on the alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) pathway involved iterative, multistakeholder development of new methods to identify cohorts of cases of ARLD from administrative datasets, characterise case mix and undertake granular segmentation and riskadjustment, creating new approaches to monitoring mortality and post-discharge outcomes, comparing provider performance and of feeding data back to the front line.  

The information tools were shared with the local health economy and integrated into an existing quality improvement (QI) programme â€“ adding value to local efforts to improve care processes and establishing new evidence for successful reductions in avoidable mortality for ARLD in the region.  

The methods and benchmarking tools have gained traction with local, national and international teams, creating opportunities to disseminate the work more widely.
