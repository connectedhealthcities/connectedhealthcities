The  model  for  a  Learning  Healthcare  System  for  the  North  West  Coast  pilots  was  to  first establish a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) hosting anonymised hospital administrative data. Work   on   the   alcohol-related   liver   disease (ARLD) pathway   involved   iterative,   multi-stakeholder development  of new  methods  to identify  cohorts  of  cases  of  ARLD  from administrative datasets, characterise case mix and undertake granular segmentation and risk-adjustment, creating new approaches to monitoring mortality and post-discharge outcomes, comparing provider performance and of feeding data back to the front line. 

The information tools  were shared  with  the  local  health  economy  and integrated  into  an existing quality improvement (QI) programmeâ€“adding value to local efforts to improve care processes and establishing new evidence for successful reductions in avoidable mortality for ARLD in the region.  The   methods   and   benchmarking   tools have   gained   traction   with local, national and international teams, creating opportunities to disseminate the work more widely.
