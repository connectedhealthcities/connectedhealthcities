The benefits of sharing patient data within data management systems are beginning to be well understood. However, it is also recognised that there are many barriers, particularly related to human factors, workforce issues and service contextual obstacles.  

Furthermore, the burden of proof of value for innovative data sharing systems lies with technology developers. This can cause problems for entrepreneurial small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in digital health, who do not have sufficient resource to undertake a robust evaluation. 

This project explored these issues. Stage 1 of the project was to explore perspectives of healthcare practitioners to understand how human factors can influence (negatively or positively) the adoption of data management innovations. Structured interviews were held with 15 practitioners across Lancashire and South Cumbria and within a number of professions.

In Stage 2, the findings from Stage 1 were discussed with representatives of digital health SMEs to consider the impact on the sector and propose actions to address issues identified.
