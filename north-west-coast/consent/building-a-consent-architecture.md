The aim of the consent architecture project was to build an interoperable, working Consent Management Architecture Model across the North West Coast, building on existing work from:

- Health Information Sharing Preferences (HISP) app design 

- Assessing/applying authentication approaches/standards already in development 

- Assessing/applying consent management models/approaches already in development
