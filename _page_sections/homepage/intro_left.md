# We've <br> changed

Connected Health Cities (CHC) united underused local health data and advanced technologies to improve health services for patients across the North of England. 

We worked with our patients to ensure our research was relevant and made real *impacts* on public health. You may not have heard of us, but you will have heard our mantra. #datasaveslives

CHC has now changed. We're sharing everything we learnt so that your authority, organisation or country can benefit from our work â€” for free.
