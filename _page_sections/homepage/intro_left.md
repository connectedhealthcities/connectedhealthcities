# Community <br> of Practice

This website contains the output from the Connected Health Cities project for anyone to view and re-use. Each section provides insight and learnings from the different regional implementations. This is presented as a collection of recipes for anyone to be able to consult and use, and, potentially contribute to as part of a global community of practice.
