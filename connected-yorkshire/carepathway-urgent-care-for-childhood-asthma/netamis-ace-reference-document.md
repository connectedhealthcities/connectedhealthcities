NETIMIS is a web based software simulation tool which uses intelligent simulation to visually explore the way in which organisations deliver care pathways using time, patient demographics, probabilities and costs. NETIMIS allows organisations to adopt and extract maximum calculate from pathway modelling with the NETIMIS tool and to fully realise its benefits.

This model has been created as part of a project with Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) and Bradford Institute for Health Research in collaboration with X-Lab. The model aims to provide a clear visualisation of the current state within the paediatric ambulatory care pathway. The results of simulating this pathway will be used to outline the benefits of replacing the Children’s Assessment Unit (CAU) with a Children’s Clinical Decision Area (CCDA). It is proposed that by making this change, there will be a reduction in hospital admission rates and by simulating this process, this can be explored.
