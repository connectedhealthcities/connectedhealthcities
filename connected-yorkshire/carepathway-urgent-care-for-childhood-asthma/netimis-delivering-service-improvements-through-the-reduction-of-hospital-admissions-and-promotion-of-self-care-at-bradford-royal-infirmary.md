NETIMIS is a web based software simulation tool which uses intelligent simulation to visually explore the way in which organisations deliver care pathways using time, patient demographics, probabilities and costs. NETIMIS allows organisations to adopt and extract maximum calculate from pathway modelling with the NETIMIS tool and to fully realise its benefits.

Working in partnership with Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) and Connected Yorkshire, X-Lab produced pathway simulation models for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust’s Children’s Assessment Unit (CAU) using NETIMIS. The aim of this was to explore potential ways in which the current practices across the CAU could be improved. The future state models, produced using NETIMIS, aimed to improve the overall care pathway across the region by reducing hospital admission rates and promoting self-care for patients.
