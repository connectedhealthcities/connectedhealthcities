NETIMIS is a web based software simulation tool which uses intelligent simulation to visually explore the way in which organisations deliver care pathways using time, patient demographics, probabilities and costs. NETIMIS allows organisations to adopt and extract maximum calculate from pathway modelling with the NETIMIS tool and to fully realise its benefits.

Working in partnership with Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) and Connected Yorkshire, X-Lab produced pathway simulation models for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust’s Children’s Assessment Unit (CAU) using NETIMIS. The aim of this was to explore potential ways in which the current practices across the CAU could be improved. The future state models, produced using NETIMIS, aimed to improve the overall care pathway across the region by reducing hospital admission rates and promoting self-care for patients.

Connected Yorkshire is one of the Connected Health Cities that aims to deliver service improvements to the Yorkshire’s population using anonymised, electronically recorded routine data available from health and social care organisations. The data will be linked anonymously and will be hosted on a digital platform at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. The de-identified linked data aims to support the redesign of pathways of care, develop and evaluate new interventions, support learning health systems and test innovative research approaches to improve health and wellbeing across the population.
