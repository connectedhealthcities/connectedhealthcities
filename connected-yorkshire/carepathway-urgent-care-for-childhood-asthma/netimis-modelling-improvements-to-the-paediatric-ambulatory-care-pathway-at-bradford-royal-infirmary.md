      title: NETIMIS Modelling Improvements to the Paediatric Ambulatory Care Pathway at Bradford Royal Infirmary

NETIMIS is a web based software simulation tool which uses intelligent simulation to visually explore the way in which organisations deliver care pathways using time, patient demographics, probabilities and costs. NETIMIS allows organisations to adopt and extract maximum calculate from pathway modelling with the NETIMIS tool and to fully realise its benefits.

This case study has been conducted as part of an undergraduate project for the University of Leeds in collaboration with X-Lab and Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI). It involved working with the Ambulatory Care Department at BRI to simulate the effects of the wide adoption of a recently piloted pathway simulation. The purpose of this was to estimate the potential reduction in hospital admissions, a cost analysis of its wider adoption and the value of alternative pathways.

Bradford City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), identified Asthma as a target for improvement in its Bradford Breathing Better Programme that was launched in January 2017. The CCG reported that between 10-40% of patients are noncompliant with their medication regimes and this non-compliance contributes to preventable hospital admissions. This suggests that hospital admissions could be reduced through better discharge advice and patient education.
