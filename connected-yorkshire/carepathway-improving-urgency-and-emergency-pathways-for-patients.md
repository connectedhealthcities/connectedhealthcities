The CUREd (urgent and emergency care) dataset covers a population of 5.5 million (Yorkshire & Humber region, UK). Routinely collected anonymised data were linked from numerous providers across the Yorkshire and Humber region including the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, NHS 111, NHS Hospital Trusts and out of hours services.

There are over 15 million episodes of care in the dataset.
- Mixed rural and urban
- 1 Ambulance Service (999 and NHS 111 services)
- 13 acute hospital trusts
- 19 EDs (â‰ˆ10% of England)

CUREd (urgent and emergency care) provides new insights into the utilisation of emergency departments and unscheduled care for vulnerable groups to inform data-driven improvements.
