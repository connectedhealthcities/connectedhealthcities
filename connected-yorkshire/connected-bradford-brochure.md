**Integrating datasets across the region**

Connected Bradford connects de-identified, longitudinal, near to real time data from different organisations for approximately 700,000 citizens across the Bradford and Airedale region into  a single database. The database is held securely at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust using the highest standards of governance and security to protect citizensâ€™ records.

Connected Bradford started in January 2016 and we discussed our approach with the Information Commissioners Office in September 2016. The database is supported by individual data sharing agreements with multiple data providers across the region. Connected Bradford has ethical approval for a research database that is overseen by a Steering Group of committed individuals from each of the different organisations who meet regularly to oversee the database and review requests for anonymised data from analysts and researchers. 

Connected Bradford also has Confidentiality Advisory Group s251 approval to link with education data and is exploring connecting to additional data sources such as crime, housing, voluntary care organisations and air quality.

The database can be used to for whole population analysis by examining trends as well as population segmentation to track care, identify patient journeys, draw conclusions, develop interventions and evaluate interventions. Our goal is to be proactive and identify citizens that are not just unwell but at risk of developing illnesses and provide them with the right care before they worsen. 

We continue to engage with our citizens and professional stakeholders to ensure that we have the support we need for population health management, learning health systems using the latest technology for service improvement, planning, evaluation and research. 
Whilst the database cannot re-identify anyone, citizens can choose not to have their records in the Connected Bradford database by liaising with their GP so their opt-out preferences can be recorded in their primary care record.
