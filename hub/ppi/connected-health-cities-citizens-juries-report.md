      title: Connected Health Cities Citizens’ Juries Report
---

Connected Health Cities commissioned the citizens’ juries to find out what people thought about some of our planned uses of health data. We chose this method of public involvement as it gave the jury members the time and opportunity to ask questions and deliberate about the range of evidence presented  to  them.  

This report tells us that, whereas the majority of people were supportive about our plans, others felt they had legitimate reasons to be concerned about whether there would be public benefit from those uses. In particular, their prior beliefs about how and why the NHS operates raised concerns about whether improving efficiency would lead to inequitable distribution or closure of services and whether the lack of funding or political will to implement new services would lead to increased public dissatisfaction due to expectations having been falsely raised.
