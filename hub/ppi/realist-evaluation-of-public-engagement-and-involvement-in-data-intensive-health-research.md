Public engagement and involvement in health research is now well established and makes a valuable contribution to the research process. However, little is known about its impact on participants. This article investigates how involvement in a data-intensive health research public forum impacts on public forum members, rather than the research process. Personal involvement portfolios were used to support their involvement work and help evaluate if and how involvement in research activities enhanced members’ personal development. This article suggests that the use of a personal involvement portfolio in a public forum will aid forum members’ personal development if they value its use as a framework for learning.  We found that women and men used and valued the portfolio for different purposes.  There seemed to be a difference in the degree to which gender affected the way members used of the portfolio and further research is needed to explore this.  In addition, evidence from this realist evaluation recommends that engagement and involvement should always be underpinned by procedures which ensure that participants receive ongoing and tailored guidance and support throughout the process.
