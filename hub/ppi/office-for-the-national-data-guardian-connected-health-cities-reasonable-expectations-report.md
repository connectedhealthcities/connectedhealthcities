  Reasonable Expectations Report
---

The  National  Data  Guardian,  Dame  Fiona  Caldicott,  and  her  office  have  responsibility  to  provide  guidance to the NHS and adult social care services, the public and other stakeholders about when it is  acceptable  to  share  information  about  patients  and  service  users.  One  potential  test  of  what  is  acceptable is whether a patient would reasonably expect confidential information to be shared. The Office of the National Data Guardian and Connected Health Cities want to better understand when a  patient  would  expect  information  sharing,  and  when  they  would  expect  information  to  be  kept  private. A citizensâ€™ jury was chosen because the approach gives a cross-section of the public several days to understand and reach conclusions about a complicated public policy such as this. Over the three day jury, a variety of different information sharing scenarios could be tested on the public.
