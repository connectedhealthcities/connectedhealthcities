The establishment of appropriate Information Governance (IG) practices was identified as being critical to the aims and objectives on theConnected Health Cities (CHC)Programme.  To this end the CHC Hub implemented an IG Workstream.  The aim of the IG workstream was to deliver IG expertise to the Hub and to each of the regional CHCs; to support and work with the IG leads in each CHC; and to liaise with the IG leads within each of the host organisations to ensure that local policies and procedures were being adhered to. The CHC appointed the Head of Information Governance, an independent IG and Privacy expert, to lead the IG workstream.

The IG Workstream produced a number of key deliverables to assist CHC regions and the Hub in addressing the range of Information Governance issues that were encountered.

A key deliverable of the workstream was the IG Working Group (IGWG) for IG leads across the CHC Programme.  The IGWG agreed that documentation to assist with the procedure of getting the required data would be an early requirement.  To this end the Head of Information Governance developed a Data Sharing Guidance Document, Data Sharing Contract and Data Sharing Agreement for use by CHC regions.  In addition, the implementation and use of an Information Sharing Gateway was also facilitated.
