A clear public engagement strategy has been at the very heart of the entire CHC programme. The team used a range of complimentary methods and approaches, with both citizens participating in core activities and outreach into communities.  There was a variety of activities ranging from citizens’ juries, focus groups and public debates, to immersive games and musical performances.
