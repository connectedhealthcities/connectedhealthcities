Working towards one of Connected Health Citiesmain aims of stimulating economic growth across the North of England, CHC has been engaging with numerous companies. The CHC Hub launched a consortium for companies active in the health ICT sector, the Pre-Competitive Collaborative Consortium (PCCC), in November 2017. This consortium ran until March 2019, when it closed in its present form. A lighter-touch continuation strategy is being explored.

The objective of the PCCC wasto tackle common(pan-industry and NHS-wide) problems in health technology research, innovation, procurement, delivery and sustainability, focusing on the north of England as the co-creation environmentfor possible solutions. The PCCC was a collaboration between industry, the health service and academia, serving as a trusted eco-system for the public-private sharing of insights into better opportunities for the deployment of eHealth, pHealth and mHealth products and services, and how to overcome the barriers to sustainable adoption, interoperabilityand scale-up.

When considering the challenges of getting novel ICT products and services adopted across the NHS, there was consensus amongst the PCCC industry members, confirmed by the experience of NHS colleagues, that the consortiumshould focus on two complementary activities to tackle two recognized problems. 

Sustainability. Working with NHS and academic change champions to define and promote the success factors that embed innovations within NHS culture and workflows, so that initial ICT pilots are more likely to be sustained as procurements and resultin definitive adoptionof the innovation.

Transferability. Working with early adopter sites to capture marketable metrics of value: a kind of KiteMark of trustworthiness and relevant benefit indicators that would help convince subsequent NHS organisations to take on the ICT innovation rather than to insist on undertaking their own pilot, starting from scratch.

Starting with small group meetings and discussions in 2017, multi-stakeholder workshops were held during 2018 in both of these areas, leading to recommendations for the design and evaluations for future ICT-driveninnovation pilots. The results of the work done on these two deliverable threads are reported in this document, to capture the learning and insights gained from these PCCC events and public-private interactions.
