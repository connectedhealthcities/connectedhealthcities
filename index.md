#  Learning Health <br> Systems

Connected Health Cities was a Government-funded programme that used information and technology to improve health and social care services for patients across the North of England. It was based on the idea of a learning health system, a means to continuously test and improve care pathways by bringing together different communities, including patients, clinicians and researchers, to create new insight.
