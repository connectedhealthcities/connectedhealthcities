#  Learning Health <br> Systems

Connected Health Cities was a Government-funded programme that used information and technology to improve health and social care services for patients across the North of England. It was based on the idea of a learning health system, a means to continuously test and improve care pathways by bringing together different communities, including patients, clinicians and researchers, to create new insight.

> Delivering trustworthy data driven improvements in care for our patient population.

## Final Report

The website also constitutes the CHC final report to its funders, the UK Department of Health and Social Care following the conclusion of the programme in March, 2020.

The purpose in hosting this report on Github is that is becomes more than just a record of activity and acts as a hub for others to build a community of practice to share ideas and experiences in building and sustaining learning health systems.

Much of the infrastructure and learning for CHC continues to be used and developed across the North of England with the [Northern Health Science Alliance](https://www.thenhsa.co.uk/).
