#  Community of <br> Practice

This website contains the output from the Connected Health Cities project for anyone to view and re-use. Each section provides insight and learnings from the different regional implementations. This is presented as a collection of recipes for anyone to be able to consult and use, and, potentially contribute to as part of a global community of practice.

Connected Health Cities was a Government-funded programme that used information and technology to improve health and social care services for patients across the North of England. It was based on the idea of a learning health system, a means to continuously test and improve care pathways by bringing together different communities, including patients, clinicians and researchers, to create new insight.

> Delivering trustworthy data driven improvements in care for our patient population.

## Final Report

The website also constitutes the CHC final report to its funders, the UK Department of Health and Social Care following the conclusion of the programme in March, 2020.

Much of the infrastructure and learning for CHC continues to be used and developed across the North of England with the [Northern Health Science Alliance](https://www.thenhsa.co.uk/).
